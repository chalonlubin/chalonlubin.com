## Tech

React | Tailwind CSS | SCSS | Nelify | Figma

## Details

Converted from JS/HTML/CSS to React. I also used Scss, along with Tailwind to assist with styling, and designed my own logos with Figma. An interesting note about this project is I treated it as if I was freelancing, so there is a wireframe, moodboard, and mock-up in figma with multiple designs as to simulate working with a client. I did face some design challenges as I wasn't sure if I should be colorful or go for a cleaner look. On my next iteration I wil opt for a cleaner less bold look, just to try somethng new. I deployed the site using nelify.

## To Do

- Responsiveness
- An interactive resume page
- Light and dark mode
- Optional music player
- Loader component
- SEO Considerations
- Conversion to Typescript
- Testing

### Thanks for stopping by!
