# Portfolio Website

My personal website showcasing my portfolio and a bit about me.

[chalonlubin.com](https://chalonlubin.com), deployed with Netlify.


## üßê Motivation & Challenges


> In building this I wanted to build something in React quickly and have a bit of fun with the styling. An interesting note about this project is I treated it as if I was freelancing, so there is a wire-frame, moodboard, and mock-up in Figma with multiple designs as to simulate working with a client.

>I did face a few challenges as I took this as a learning opportunity to use DasiyUI, Tailwind and SCSS which I realized it would of been better to of stuck to just Tailwind or SCSS.  I ended up removing DaisyUI and building mostly with Tailwind, using SCSS when needed.

## üíª Tech Stack & Packages

**React | Tailwind CSS | DaisyUI | SCSS | Netlify | Figma**

_react-dom | react-router-dom_


## üì¶ Install & Run
