### To Run

1. `git clone <link>`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. `npm test` for testing

## Tech

React | Tailwind CSS | DaisyUI | SCSS | Netlify | Figma

## Details

v1: Pure HTML /CSS 
v2: Converted from JS/HTML/CSS to React. I also used Scss, along with Tailwind to assist with styling.and designed my own logos with Figma.
v3: Updated styling, responsivness, and feel of site, along with content. Improved lighthouse score by 80% on desktop. 

An interesting note about this project is I treated it as if I was freelancing, so there is a wire-frame, moodboard, and mock-up in figma with multiple designs as to simulate working with a client. 

I did face a few challenges as I took this as a learning opporunity to use DasiyUI, tailwind and SCSS which I really just need SCSS or Tailwind. Eventually I'll remove Tailwind and build purley on SCSS. I'd like to utilize more react hooks and build complex features at a later time. I would also like to convert to Next.js on the next iteration. 

## To Do
