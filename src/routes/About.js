        <p>
          I'm a freelance software engineer. I've also been a bartender and bar
          manager for the last few years, and prior to that I was a mental
          health program director. I have pivoted to software engineering
          because I find it mentally engaging, and great way to express a mix of
          logic and creativity. I'm currently open to employment opportunities,
          lets touch base if you have something to offer or just want to
          connect.
